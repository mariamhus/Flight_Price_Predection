‚óè     
you are supposed to implement end to end data science
project in which you do the following tasks:


1- The full EDA process
in which you must  :


1.    investigate each feature type and values (univariate
analysis )


2.    investigate the relationship between features (bivariate /
multivariate analysis )


3.    clean your data to be properly analyzed.


4.    create business questions which can be answered through
the analysis of data and answer it through numbers and visualization.


 


2- Data Preparation
process for machine learning Regression task , in which you must :


1.    Deal with missing data if any.


2.    Deal with outliers if any.


3.    Feature Engineering.


4.    Encode your categorical features with the appropriate type
of encoding if needed.


5.    Feature scaling if needed.


Note, there is no
meaning for the order in the previous steps , do the process in the appropriate
order from your point of view.


 


3-Machine Learning Modeling:


1.    You need to build a Regression model which will Predict the Price of the airline flights


4- Deploy your model using streamlit cloud

1 - Video in which you explain every thing realted to your work.
2 - Your notebook that has all the detailed work.
3 - .py file by which you deploy your model.
4 - The public streamlit cloud link to check your project working
